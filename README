A simple and fast iCal parser.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This library is based on http://github.com/fangel/SG-iCalendar but
updated for PHP 5.3+ namespaces.  The re-organization is different enough
that I renamed the top-level namespace to intouch from SG, but so far
nothing was changed code-wise from the original fork, except:

- namespaced class names replace original ones
- build.cmd and build.sh removed, assume a PSR-0 style autoload env
- composer.json added
- demo updated to fetch jquery, fullcalendar and an up to date ICS file from
  the network

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A simple example :

 use intouch\ical\iCal;
 $ical = new iCal( "./basic.ics" );
 //or
 $ical = new iCal( "http://example.com/calendar.ics" );
 foreach( $ical->getEvents() As $event ) {
   // Do stuff with the event $event
 }

To check unit tests with phpunit, goto tests/ directory and :
 phpunit AllTests
 phpunit helpers/FreqTest
 ./test.sh

TODO :
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

(this is from the original repo, now on my TODO ...)

These iCal keywords are not supported for the moment :
 - RECURRENCE-ID : to move one event from a recurrence
 - EXRULE : to exclude multiple days by a complex rule

Also, multiple RRULE could be specified for an event,
but that is not the case for most calendar applications
